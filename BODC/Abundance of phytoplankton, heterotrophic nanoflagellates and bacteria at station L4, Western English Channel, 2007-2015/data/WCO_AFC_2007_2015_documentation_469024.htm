<h3>Originator's Protocol for Data Acquisition and Analysis</h3>
<h4>Sample Collection</h4>
<p>Triplicate seawater samples are collected from the rosette bottle sampler at the surface, 10, 25 and 50 m. Samples are collected in 0.25L square polycarbonate bottles that have been rinsed with seawater. The bottles are then stored in a coolbox and transported back to the laboratory for analysis. The time taken between sample collection and the beginning of analysis is between 3.5 to 5.5 hours, depending on the state of the tide and access through the lock gates of Sutton Harbour, Plymouth.</p>
<h4>Sample preservation for analysis of bacteria and heterotrophic nanoflagellates (HNAN)</h4>
<p>Triplicate samples are measured for each sample. 15 &micro;L of 50% glutaraldehyde solution was slowly pipetted into the 5 mL sample tubes (which provides approx. 0.5% glutaraldehyde final concentration after sample addition). The sea water sample is then carefully inverted 4 times before 1.5 mL of sample is pipetted into the relevant sample tube. A lid is then placed on the sample tube. The tubes are then hand vortexed (flicking the bottom of the tube with a finger) to ensure even mixing of glutaraldehyde (very cold glutaraldehyde can take up to 15 vortexes before it mixes). Preserved samples are then placed in a refrigerator for 30 minutes.</p>
<h4>Flow cytometric analysis of live nano- and picophytoplankton using the BD Accuri C6 flow cytometer</h4>
<p>The water sample bottle is inverted 4 times before a 2 mL sample is pipetted into a clean sample tube. The sample is hand vortexed before being discarded down the sink. The flow rate for the BD Accuri is set to 100 &micro;L per minute and the core size is 15 &micro;m. The sample was then analysed for 5 minutes. This process is completed for all samples. Once all live phytoplankton samples have been analysed samples of Beckman Coulter Flowset fluorospheres are run to calibrate the flow rate as outlined in the calibration of flow cytometer flow rate section below.</p>
<h4>Staining of preserved samples for bacteria and HNAN analysis</h4>
<p>Once samples had been fixed for at least 30 minutes a 2 &micro;L aliquot of Sybr Green I DNA dye is obtained from a freezer. A sample tube is then filled with 300 mM potassium citrate buffer (0.1 &micro;m filtered and kept in the refrigerator). 2 mL of the buffer is then removed with a pipettor whilst the rest of the sample is discarded and the 2 mL buffer is placed back in the tube. A different pipettor then removes 150 &micro;L of the buffer from the 2mL sample and added to the 2 &micro;L Sybr Green I aliquot. The Sybr/buffer is then physically mixed and pipetted into the remaining buffer (1.35 mL) which is then mixed again. The samples are then removed from the refrigerator and 150 &micro;L of buffer/Sybr Green is then added to each sample. The lids are then replaced and each sample is hand vortexed. The samples are then placed in a drawer (in the dark at room temperature) for at least 1 hour.</p>
<h4>Calibration of flow cytometer flow rate - whilst samples are staining</h4>
<p>The flow rate of the flow cytometer is calibrated by analysing samples of fluorescent microspheres (beads) at a known concentration for a set length of time. The beads used are Beckman Coulter Flowset fluorescent microspheres. These beads are used because they are of a similar size to the nano- and picoplankton (they are 3.6 &micro;m in diameter) and their fluorescence emission is in the same range so that instrument settings do not need to be altered. Bead stock concentration is determined using a Beckman Coulter Multisizer 3. This determination is covered by a separate Standard Operating Method.</p>
<h4>High flow rate calibration</h4>
<p>Three flow cytometry sample tubes are used. One is filled with Elga/Milli-Q (de-ionised) water. A bottle of beads is removed from the refrigerator and inverted for 1 minute to ensure the beads are evenly suspended for at least 1 minute. Whilst the bottle is being inverted 900 &micro;L of water from the filled tube is then pipetted into one of the empty tubes. Once the bottle has been inverted for 1 minute 4-5 drops of beads are then pipetted into the remaining empty tube. 100 &micro;L are then removed from the tube and added to the 900 &micro;L of Milli-Q water, which should now give a 10x dilution of the based suspension, and is subsequently hand vortexed. The tube is then inserted into the Sample Input Port (SIP) of the flow cytometer and analysed on high flow rate for 2 minutes. Once analysis is completed the sample is hand vortexed again, tapped and placed on the SIP of the flow cytometer and analysed again. This step is then repeated for a third time. Once completed a bivariate plot of orange vs. red fluorescence is plotted. The beads should appear as a line with single beads in the bottom left, then doublets showing as a cluster (approx. double the fluorescence of the single beads), then triplets and above. The clusters are separated and identified with the numbers for each region recorded. The numbers are then inserted into a spreadsheet and doublets are multiplied by two and triplets multiplied by three etc. The sum of these figures gives the total number of beads analysed and the flow rate can be calculated as microliters per minute as follows:</p>
<p>Flow rate ( &micro;L min<sup>-1</sup>) = ((Total Count/Diluted bead concentration)*1000)/2</p>
<h4>Flow cytometric analysis of preserved bacteria, stained with Sybr Green I</h4>
<p>A stained sample is collected from the dark and hand vortexed. The sample is subsequently placed on the SIP of the flow cytometer and analysed. The time limit is set to 2 minutes and the flow rate is set to FAST (nominally 66 &micro;L per minute and the core size is 15 &micro;m). The sample is then stored and saved for heterotrophic nanoflagellate analysis and the next sample is analysed and the process is repeated until all samples have been analysed.</p>
<h4>Flow cytometric analysis of heterotrophic nanoflagellates, stained with Sybr Green I</h4>
<p>A stained sample is removed from the dark and hand vortexed. The sample is placed on the SIP of the flow cytometer and analysed for 7 minutes with a flow rate set to 100 &micro;L per minute and core size of 15 &micro;m. Once the 7 minutes have been completed the sample is removed and a new sample is analysed until all samples have been analysed.</p>
<h3>Analysis of data files</h3>
<p>Cell abundance is calculated as cells per millilitre</p>
<h4>Live phytoplankton</h4>
<p>Cells per mL = cell count * (1000 / (Flow rate * Analysis time (minutes)))</p>
<h4>Preserved phytoplankton</h4>
<p>Cells per mL = cell count * (1000 / (Flow rate * Analysis time (minutes))) * (1665/1500)</p>

<h3>BODC Data Processing Procedures</h3>
<p>The metadata and data were received by email from the originator in an Excel file, whilst a pdf containing the methodology was downloaded from the WCO website. These files were subsequently archived following BODC procedure. The parameters supplied by the originator were mapped to BODC parameters and the samples were mapped to corresponding CTD profiles with the depths from the bottle firing applied where possible. In the cases where there was no CTD bottle firing or no bottle appeared to be taken then the originators depth was used and the bottle was subsequently flagged. The data was then loaded to the to the National Oceanographic Database (NODB).</p>
